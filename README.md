# Guess_Number_Game

This is a simple number guessing game written in Python. The program generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the player has to guess the correct number within a limited number of attempts.

## How to Play
1. Run the Python script guess_number_game.py.
2. The program will display a welcome message along with the game logo(logo generated from ASCII).
3. You will be prompted to choose a difficulty level: 'easy' or 'hard'.
4. If you choose 'easy', you will have 10 attempts to guess the number. If you choose 'hard', you will have only 5 attempts.
5. Enter your guess when prompted. The program will tell you if your guess is too high, too low, or correct.
6. Keep guessing until you either guess the correct number or run out of attempts.
7. If you guess the number correctly within the allotted attempts, you win. Otherwise, you lose the game.
